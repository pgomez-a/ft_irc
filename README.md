# ft_irc

ToDo List:
- Implementar parser
- Implementar comandos
- Gestionar canales
- Gestionar operadores
- (ComunicaciÃ³n segura)
- (Implementar bot)

Without a doubt, this is one of the most amazing projects we have done during our 42 journey. This time we had to implement our own **IRC server.** Thanks to this, we have gained a lot of experience in both **socket programming** and **parser development.** We have tried to make it as commercial as possible, always adjusting to the specifications of the subject. If you encounter any problems using it, please feel free to contact us to resolve it. And now, it's time to have fun playing with the **nameless server**... ðŸ¤¯

Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/pgomez-a/ft_irc.git ; cd ft_irc
    
Compile the program:

    make
    
Run the server on a port of your choice with a password:

    # ./ircserv <port> <password>
    ./ircserv 8080 server_password
